# CHTML
   A library built using c++ for writing static html pages with styling.
# Aim:
   The Aim is to utilize the String handling features available in C++ to create a library named chtml.h which has some classes written in it.Users can create objects of these classes and by simply invoking functions can create html files such as adding headers,paragraphs,links,tables,lists,images,butons and manymore.They can also include styling in their html documents.So, now users can simply create html files using C++ without actually writing them in editors as they traditionally did.
# Classes Available:
   There are two classes available to the users one is named xml which contains functions to only open tags,close tags,insert text,set attributes.Other one is named html which contains many more functions.Users who dont know html tag structure can use class html whereas people who know the html tag structure can use both xml and html class.
# Steps to Run:
       1.Create a folder in your pc.
       2.Copy the header file chtml.h(present in lib folder) to your folder.
       3.Create a .cpp file in the same folder with any name.
       4.Now include chtml.h in this.cpp file as shown below
       
              #include<iostream>
              #include"chtml.h"
              using namespace std;
              int main()
              {
                     try{
                     html obj;
                     obj.add_title("WELCOME");
                     string cars[]={"Ferrari","BMW","Lamborgini"};
                     obj.add_list(cars,"ul");
                     obj.dump();
                     }
                     catch(const char* msg){
                     cout<<msg<<endl;
                     }
       
                     return 0;
              }
       5.View the test.cpp file in test folder for further clarity.   
       6.Use dump(filename) to dump the code to a html file.Open it with any web browser.
       7.For list of functions available view the api.md in api folder.
