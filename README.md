# CHTML
   CHTML is a library built using c++ for writing html documents.It has no dependencies on other projects,only on the C++ standard library.
# Building
   For use in a project you can copy the chtml.h file present in lib folder.
# Usage
   The basis of this library is the xml class and the html class.
   The xml class has functions to create the tag struture.(Refer file version1.0api.md in api folder)
   
   A sample of what you can do using xml class            
            
            xml obj;
            obj.open_tag("p");//opens a p tag
            obj.insert_text("Hello");//writes text 
            obj.close_tag("p");//closes the p tag
