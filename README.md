# CHTML
Developing a library in C++ to create HTML files using C++
# Aim:
  The Aim is to utilize the file handling features available in C++ to create a library named chtml.h which has some classes 
  written in it.Users can create objects of these classes and by simply invoking functions can create html files such as adding 
  headers,paragraphs,links,tables,lists,images,butons and manymore.They can also include styling in their html documents.
  So, now users can simply create html files using C++ without actually writing them in editors as they traditionally did.
# Steps to Run:
1.Create a folder in your pc.
2.Copy the header file chtml.h(present in lib folder) to your folder.
3.Create a .cpp file in the same folder with any name.
4.Now include this header in this .cpp file(see the sample code below)
        #include<iostream>
        #include"chtml.h"
        using namespace std;
        int main()
        {
        html obj;
        obj.create_file("sample");
        obj.add_title("Welcome");
        return 0;
        }
5.As shown above create a file and see the list of available functions.
6.A html file will be automatically created in your folder.Open it with any web browser.
